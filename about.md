Hey! I'm a software developer from Vancouver, Canada.

I currently work as CTO at [bigmama.ca](http://bigmama.ca/) building out and maintaining our Ruby on Rails application(among other things like making coffee, and hi-five-ing everyone).

I co-organize the [Code and Coffee(Vancouver) Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Code-Coffee-Vancouver/), which is meant to help developers carve out time to work on personal projects.

I also mentor and instruct for [Ladies Learning Code](http://ladieslearningcode.com/).

I grow vegetables on my 2x8 ft balcony, and am mother to two sassy little girls, aged 2 and 4.

Tweet me at [@jncoops](http://twitter.com/jncoops), read my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/jenncoop), find my CV on [LinkedIn](http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/jennifer-cooper/11/3b7/24a/).

Have a nice day. â™¥
