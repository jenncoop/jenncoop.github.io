We had our first [meetup](http://meetup.com/code-coffee-vancouver) this past Tuesday! In case you're wondering, it was pretty OKAY! Nobody died, also the wifi held up (yay!). 

#### Meetup Stats:
- The day before the meetup, we had 40 people signed up, with a few on the waitlist.
- By 5pm on the day of, we had 32 people signed up.
- We had 23 people actually show up.

#### Good Parts:
- The turnout was ~55% women!!!
- There was enough space for everyone to sit comfortably.
- The Waves staff were really accomodating.
- Nobody had to wait long for coffee/treats.
- The people in attendance were quite pleasant, and gave plenty of constructive feedback.

#### Not-so-good Parts:
- Some people wanted to 'work', while others wanted to 'discuss'.
- Those that did want to discuss, had a hard time hearing eachother.

These results lead me to ask a couple questions.

1. Do we accomodate people who want to discuss, or people who want to work? Or both?
2. Does this venue serve our needs if we want to include people who would like to discuss.

More on this later!
