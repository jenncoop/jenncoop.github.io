            My Notes on Hiring
          </h1>
          <p>Disclaimer: I am NOT a self-proclaimed hiring expert.</p>

<p>These are my notes so far on hiring. This list will likely change as I acquire knowledge and feedback from others, so feel free to <a href="mailto:cooper.jennl@gmail.com">reach out</a> if you&rsquo;d like to discuss.</p>

<p>Hiring in the tech industry is one of those tricky things that I&rsquo;ll likely never fully understand.</p>

<h4>Here&rsquo;s the WHY: People are messy and complicated.</h4>

<p>My belief is that technical skill is important, but the following are WAY more important. Smart, passionate people can learn technology when given the chance.</p>

<h4>1. Hire for empathy</h4>

<p>Everyone is different, but we often relate to each other based on our experiences. People who&rsquo;ve had similar experiences in life are often more comfortable with each other. However, most of the time, there is a sizeable chasm between what any two people have been through in their lives. In my experience, empathetic people are more capable of conceptualizing another person&rsquo;s point of view, even if it differs drastically from their own. They&rsquo;re able to question their own opinions, or in the least understand how another person could conceivable entertain a different viewpoint. This type of dynamic is hugely important in a team setting where open and constructive dialogue is necessary for growth.</p>

<h4>2. Watch out for feigned empathy</h4>

<p>There are some pretty excellent actors out there. Trying to discern whether a person is legitimately empathetic or whether there&rsquo;s &lsquo;something else&rsquo; happening can be really difficult. People often reveal themselves within the first month or two of work. This is why it often pays to start people off with a month-long contract&hellip;</p>

<h4>3. Try a month (or some finite duration of time)</h4>

<p>This is something we did at BigMama, and it worked very well. People who weren&rsquo;t a good fit for the company had often moved on by the time a month came around. People who were a good fit stayed. This works well for developers because it gives them a chance to chill out and do their work in a real work setting, as opposed to an interview setting. </p>

<h4>4. Hire for humility</h4>

<p>+1 for a person who is able to legitimately say &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo; in an interview. This response often leads to discussion and further revelation. Also, I usually start jumping up and down when I meet someone who&rsquo;s able to discuss their failures. I think this is indicative of the ability to reflect, which leads to learning and growth (YAY).</p>

<h4>5. Evidence of grit/hard stuff</h4>

<p>Has this person done anything hard? Have they suffered with something? Learning what a person finds to be hard is very interesting, and telling. This one gets tricky, and actually requires a fair amount of empathy from the interviewer. What one person finds to be easy, another can find to be incredibly difficult. As an interviewer you need to know how to ask the right questions to allow someone to feel safe enough to mention the hard stuff. Hard stuff shapes who we are and how we respond to stress.</p>

<h4>6. Traditional interviews will never work in tech</h4>

<p>Unless your business requires you to regurgitate redundant algorithms on the fly, please don&rsquo;t ever ask a developer to write a binary search tree or merge sort in an interview. Just don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s condescending. My opinion is that people who are able to recall this type of information on the fly are more comfortable with an &lsquo;artificial&rsquo; environment (like school, for example) and may not cope well in a more fluid environment. Sidebar: Developers fresh out of a CS degree (or such) may cope just fine, but they’ve spent the greater part of their lives in an artificial environment, so I think cutting them a little slack here is probably the right thing to do. OR even better, never ask them to regurgitate!</p>

<h4>7. Evidence of creative outlet</h4>

<p>Does this person paint? Is this person excited and passionate about something outside of technology? People with other facets and dimensions have never been a bad thing in my experience.</p>
